For all Psychological Buffs, there is a base variable (psychXPmodifier) that is multiplied or divided by RNG. This affects the player XP, by a lot or a little depending on the psychBuff. Certain psychBuffs will also affect other Player Stats, such as being Afraid gives you a temporary boost to your stamina, while as traumatized will be detrimental to the Player's stamina. Prolonged periods in the Afraid state will lead to the Stressed Out state, and on.
