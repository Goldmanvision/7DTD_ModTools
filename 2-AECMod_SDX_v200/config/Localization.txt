Hopefully I can fit at least a couple paragraphs before it goes kaput.\n\nIf I want to put a door code in [4012] the letter, this is how I would do it.\n\nI think this should be an effective method of driving the story forward.\n\nGood luck and Godspeed,\nDr. Alan Strauss, Stanford Research Institute",

AECnoteTest02Desc,items,Special Items,,,"July 23, 1954\n\nHello Alan,\nI feel it would be appropriate for us to address each other by our first names, as we will be working closely together (literally and figuratively) for quite some time. I'm not positive how many different icons we will be able to use that are built into the 7D2D, however we can make our own custom icons if need be. In order to fit with the look and feel of 7D2D, making it compatible with later versions, we must avoid making custom graphical resources wherever possible. The real story plays out in your mind, Alan.\n\nBest regards,\nDr. Marie W. Crenshaw, Atomic Energy Commission"

How it's so clean and... yeah... I have no idea. I found some signs and papers around with Atomic Energy Commission letterhead. My guess is that they ran this place. For what purpose, I have no idea, but it's clean, warm, and some of this stuff still works. I take it you'll be staying a few nights. Just stay away from me and my things and we'll get along juuuuuust fine."

I prefer not to talk about that... [Kacey trails off]\n\nI knew when things started happening that the Southwest would probably be the safest place to go. Having crossed two-thirds of the United States to get here, I'd say that assessment was correct. Have you been outside of Arizona? It's... it's horrific. The zombies are the least of your worries."

I've honestly been a bit nervous about opening titanium vault doors around here. After all, this place was operated by the Atomic Energy Commission. For all I know, we could be recieving lethal doses of radiation right now. I've been here a few days, and I'm not coughing up blood, not yet at least."
dialog_KaceyGellar_statement_help_03,Quest,Dialogs,,,"After you're settled, take a look around, see if you can find a way to get some of these doors opened up. If I'm gonna die, I'd rather it be down here than up there."

dialog_KaceyGellar_statement_help_bedroll_place,Quest,Dialogs,,,"This space seems pretty comfy and it's near the entrance. If you want to put down a bedroll and camp out in the opposite corner, we can watch each other's backs. Problem with horror movies is everyone always splits up. I don't understand why they always split up!"
dialog_KaceyGellar_statement_help_bedroll_no,Quest,Dialogs,,,"I guess you could camp anywhere you want. I just think if this was a horror movie, which, I mean, you know... zombies... I think it's dumb to split up if we're working together."

DLAMP_01_tip,Journal Tip,,,,"This bunker, D-LAMP, was created by the Atomic Energy Commission. Another survivor who made their way in before me claims to have found paper and documents indentifying it as such. The two documents she found were dated 1958.\n\nMany of the doors are locked by a keycode, but at least one code, [4936], was written on the found documents.\n\nThe survivor has been too afraid to open the door, and she's got a good reason. If we open the wrong door, we might contaminate the facility with deadly radiation.\n\nShe suggests we look for more information before we start poking around, but the drawers and safes are sealed shut. I'm going to need some lockpicks if I plan on getting them open."

I can't be sure, but I have to imagine that took years. She's cagey about her details.\n\nWhat's important though, if she's still alive after all that, and managed to find this top-secret government nuke base all by herself, she must be resourceful. Best keep an eye on her. This could be a trap."
